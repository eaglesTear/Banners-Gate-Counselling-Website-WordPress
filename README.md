Banners Gate Counselling Website (old WordPress build)

A functional site for a local charity where I am also a volunteer. Built using WordPress in 2020 in collaboration with a trustee. However, it is outdated in terms of design and accessibility and my new site built with Node.js is ongoing. I still assist with site maintenance.
